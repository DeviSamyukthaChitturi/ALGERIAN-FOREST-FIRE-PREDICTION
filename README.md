# ALGERIAN-FOREST-FIRE-PREDICTION

Welcome to the Algerian Forest Fire Prediction dataset repository! 
#### Overview
The Algerian Forest Fire Prediction project aims to leverage data-driven insights to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) score and classify the likelihood of fire occurrences in Algerian forests. By utilizing various meteorological and environmental features, this project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including polynomial regression and logistic regression, to achieve accurate predictions.

The goal is to provide valuable tools for forest management and fire prevention strategies, ultimately contributing to the protection of natural resources and minimizing the devastating impacts of forest fires.
#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and classify fire occurrences in Algerian forests. This will aid in early detection and prevention strategies to mitigate the risk and impact of forest fires.
#### Goal
The goal of the Algerian Forest Fire Prediction project is to accurately predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and classify fire occurrences using machine learning techniques. This aims to enhance forest management and contribute to effective fire prevention strategies.
#### Potential Aplications
Forest Management: Enhancing decision-making for proactive fire prevention strategies and resource allocation in forested areas.
